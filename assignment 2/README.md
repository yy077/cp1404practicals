# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Must-See Movies 2.0 by Yang ruishen

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of movies.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you in working hours?

Estimate: 8 hours
Actual: 12 hours

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The successful implementation of the Movie and MovieCollection classes that work seamlessly in both console and GUI applications. The clean separation of concerns between the model and the view.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The GUI layout could be more polished, and I struggled with the dynamic button creation initially.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Following the recommended order: classes  tests  console  GUI. This made debugging much easier.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Spend more time planning the GUI layout before coding. Also, commit more frequently during development.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Lecture notes for class implementation

Kivy demos for GUI patterns

Python documentation for JSON handling

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The biggest challenge was understanding how to associate data with Kivy buttons. I overcame this by using the button.movie attribute pattern shown in the guitars_app.py demo.
