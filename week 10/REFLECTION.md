# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. I often underestimated the time required for more complex tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became better at breaking down tasks and identifying potential challenges, which led to more accurate estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to plan more realistically and allow time for debugging and reviewing. Estimating helped me better manage my time and workload.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to look at my code more critically and consider readability, structure, and best practices beyond just functionality.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me spot common mistakes, learn alternative approaches, and improve my understanding of good coding style.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review for Prac 7 - Guitar Inventory](https://github.com/yunchenli375/cp1404practicals/pull/1#event-18604669446)

### Explanation

I gave specific feedback on naming conventions and suggested simplifying a loop for better readability. I also highlighted good practices already used.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review for Prac 9 - Cleanup Files](https://github.com/YuanXin425/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

In this review, I commented on code organization and the use of constants. I also confirmed functionality and offered suggestions to improve clarity.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more real-world mini-projects or challenges that allow students to apply multiple concepts together, especially in the later weeks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently completed tasks on time, thoroughly tested my code, and applied feedback from code reviews to improve future work.
