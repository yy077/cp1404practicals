## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started organizing my study materials more effectively by creating digital folders and using note-taking apps to keep track of important concepts and code snippets. This has helped me quickly review and understand the material when I need to.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to allocate more consistent time for practical coding sessions. Often, I find myself rushing through the coding exercises, which leads to mistakes and a lack of deep understanding. I plan to schedule specific coding hours in my weekly routine.

I have been actively participating in online forums and discussions related to the subject. This has helped me gain different perspectives on problems and solutions, and I will continue to engage with my peers to enhance my learning experience.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on starting assignments. I tend to leave tasks until the last minute, which increases stress and reduces the quality of my work. I will implement a more structured schedule to manage my time better.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more opportunities for one-on-one consultations with professors or teaching assistants. This would allow for personalized feedback and guidance, which I believe would greatly benefit my understanding and application of the course material.
