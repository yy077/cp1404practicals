# Reflection

## What did you learn this week?
- I learned how to refactor code into functions to make it more modular and reusable.
- I practiced using PyCharm's refactoring tools to simplify the process.
- I gained experience in writing functions that follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

## What challenges did you face?
- Initially, I found it challenging to separate concerns and ensure functions did only one thing.
- I had to think carefully about how to structure the menu in `score_menu.py` to handle different options.

## How did you overcome these challenges?
- I reviewed the principles of SRP and focused on keeping functions simple and focused.
- I tested each function individually to ensure they worked correctly before integrating them into the main program.
- I used print statements and debugging tools to identify and fix issues in my code.

## What are you looking forward to next week?
- I am excited to apply the skills I've learned to more complex programs.
- I am curious about how functions can be used in larger projects and how they can be optimized for performance.
