# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Must-See Movies

Assignment 1 for CP1404, IT@JCU

By: Yang Ruishen

This repo contains starter files:  

- `assignment1.py` is the file you must write your assignment code in.
- `movies.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
- `movies_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... This is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.
- `README.md` is the file you're reading. You must edit this to answer the questions below.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

    About five days

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

    I will try my best not to make the same mistakes as in the first assignment in the next one and attempt to use more standardized language and usage
